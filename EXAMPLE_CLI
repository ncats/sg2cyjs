# Prerequisites

Tested on Python 3.7.2 bit should likely work on Python 3.6, 3.7 or above.

* Install NetworkX Python library [ https://networkx.github.io/ ]:

pip install networkx


# Extracting a SmartGraph subnetwork

* Download a network from SmartGraph [ https://smartgraph.ncats.io ] using the "Download graph" button at the bottom-left corner of the network visualization panel, then selecting the "Cytoscape JSON" option.

# Convert the downloaded file to "Cytoscape JSON" compliant format.

In the example command-line below substitute "sg_export_example" with the filename of your downloaded network in "Cytoscape JSON" format.

(Please use the ".cyjs" extension in the output filename as shown in the command line below.)

Command-line:


python sg_cleanup_cyjs.py sg_export_example sg_network.cyjs



* Import to "Cytoscape" desktop client

Go to "File->Import->Network->File" and select the output file you generated above, i.e. "sg_network.cyjs" in the example.

Of note, you'll need to run a layout algorithm on the imported network.
